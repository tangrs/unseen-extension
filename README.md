# Unseen extension for Firefox

**Note** 

This plugin isn't maintained much anymore. From the start, this plugin was written to serve its basic purpose until a better and more polished plugin comes out.

There is now, a much more polished extension by Crossrider called [Chat Undetected](http://crossrider.com/install/14917-chat-undetected). I suggest users to switch to this rather than continue to use this unmaintained plugin.

To the previous users, thanks for using this hasitily written plugin up until now.

## Old readme

![Screenshot of Facebook's 'seen' status](http://i45.tinypic.com/2yv44r7.png)

Facebook has a new feature where the other party is notified once you read their message. Sometimes you may not want this for privacy reasons.

This extension simply blocks sending your 'seen' status from being sent to the other party.

Bug reports can be sent to tangrs at tangrs.id.au

## Known problems

If you open the other party's inbox, the 'seen' status will still be sent.

Since it indiscriminantly blocks the 'seen' status from being sent, it means Facebook won't know you've read the message either and will probably show a notification on your inbox icon.

## Warranties/Legal

This plugin comes with no warranty or guarantees blah blah blah... You're using this at your risk and I can't be held responsible for any social awkwardness or otherwise caused by the potential failure of this extension.

Licence is the Mozilla Public License version 2.0.

## Building

Run ```./build.sh``` in this directory.
